2. Description of the Approach

The approach to building this project was methodical and focused on ensuring that the final product would not only be functional but also visually appealing and user-friendly. The process can be broken down into several key steps:

	1.	Content Planning:
	•	The first step involved gathering all relevant personal information and professional experience, which formed the foundation of the content for the website. This included details about Yutthana’s background, skills, work experience, and contact information.
	•	After gathering the content, a structure was planned that would best present this information, ensuring that the most critical details were easy to find and well-organized.
	2.	Design and Layout:
	•	The layout was designed to be clean, modern, and responsive, ensuring that it would work well on a variety of devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
	•	CSS was used to apply a consistent style across the website, with an emphasis on readability and aesthetics. The color scheme and typography were chosen to reflect a professional tone while maintaining a visually engaging design.
	3.	Development and Coding:
	•	HTML was used to structure the content into logical sections, such as About Me, Experience, Skills, Portfolio, References, and Contact.
	•	CSS was applied to style these sections, ensuring that each one stood out while contributing to the overall cohesiveness of the site. Flexbox and grid layouts were utilized to manage spacing and alignment, making the site both flexible and robust.
	•	JavaScript was added to enhance user interaction. For instance, an alert message was triggered when users clicked on different sections, demonstrating basic interactivity and adding a layer of engagement.
	4.	Testing and Refinement:
